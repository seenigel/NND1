- What is data journalism? 
- What is data? 
- Where can you find data?


## What is Data Journalism?
It's a different way of telling the news, one that relies less on anecdotes and more on measurable facts and statistics.

When done well, data stories can very effectively answer the following questions:
- [What's happening right now?](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/18/world/americas/hurricane-maria-tracking-map.html)
- [What has happened in the past?](https://patch.com/new-york/heights-dumbo/new-yorks-most-dangerous-intersection-brooklyn-study)
- [What's changed or different?](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/13/upshot/where-people-in-each-state-were-born.html#New_York)
- [How widespread, common, or rare is something?](https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170306/upper-east-side/parking-tickets-department-of-finance-nypd-renthop-driving)



## So what is data?
Data's the paper trail. 
- It's the forms that people fill out when to [register their new dog with the city](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/vet/vet-doglicense-form.pdf). - [Example](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/08/realestate/dogs-of-new-york.html)
- It's the parking ticket you got when you were late getting back to the meter.
- It’s the records the city has to keep when you call 311 to complain about the lack of heat in your building.
- It’s the transcripts or video tapes of public meetings.
- It’s the study that a university, or laboratory or think tank has been conducting.

## Where do you find data?
Your first stop for data is *traditionally* the government. They're usually mandated by law to keep track of various statistics and often they'll have it published on their website. So think about the type of information you want, and then think about the government agency that would have it.

- Schools: [NYC Department of Education](http://schools.nyc.gov/Accountability/data/default.htm)
- Crime: [NYPD](http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/crime_prevention/crime_statistics.shtml)
- Demographics: [US Census Bureau](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml), [NYC Department of City Planning](http://gis.nyc.gov/census/)
- Traffic: [NYC Department of Transportation](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/about/datafeeds.shtml)
- Subways, buses: [MTA](http://web.mta.info/nyct/facts/ridership/index.htm)


New York City actually has a wealth of data uploaded to a website called [NYC Open Data](http://nycopendata.socrata.com). At Open Data you can find:

- [Taxi Pickups](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/browse?q=taxi)
- [Car Crashes](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95/data)
- [311 Complaints](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9/data)
- [Restaurant Inspections](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/xx67-kt59)
- [Parking Tickets](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2018/pvqr-7yc4)
- And much, much more.


Other data sources include:
- Colleges and universities (they're always doing studies and reports)
- Non-profit and advocacy groups
	- NYU’s Furman Center [keeps great data on neighborhoods]( http://furmancenter.org/neighborhoods) 
- For-profit companies, especially today’s modern, web-centric companies. 
	- [StreetEasy](http://streeteasy.com/blog/download-data/), a site where you can list apartment rentals and sales, [has tons of data on apartment prices](http://streeteasy.com/blog/download-data/)
    - The [Straphangers Campaign](https://www.straphangers.org/) is a subway advocacy group that publishes annual reports on the state of the subway.

## Exercise Times
Click the link below to open a section of the Straphangers Campaign's most recent subway report card, where they rate all of New York's Subway lines from best to worst across a bunch of different metrics.

Split into groups, take a look at the the information in the report, and brainstorm three story ideas.

## Things to remember
- Always check your data. Make sure it's correct. Talk to experts in the subject, ask them if what you're seeing makes sense.
- You're still a reporter. Data is just another source. You don't want to use data *instead* of sources and expert, you want to use data *with* sources, to amplify or challenge what's being told to you.

Once we’ve got data, how do we make sense of it?
